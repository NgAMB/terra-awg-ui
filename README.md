# Terra AWG - Alternative worldgen for Terraria

![Map Banner](img/map.png)

Terra AWG is a standalone tool for generating vanilla Terraria compatible
worlds. It gives a fresh imagining of what exploration could be, while
maintaining normal world progression.

## Usage

- Edit `terra-awg.ini` to choose world size, etc.
- Run `terra-awg` to generate a new world (If you want to read the messages,
  run the program through command prompt/powershell/terminal, instead of just
  clicking on it)
- Copy the new `*.wld` file into your saves folder (something like
  `Documents\My Games\Terraria\Worlds`)
